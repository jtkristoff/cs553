	abstract = {Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDT) are usually classified as either state-based or operation-based. However, the standard definition of op-based CRDTs is very encompassing, allowing even sending the full-state, blurring the distinction. We introduce pure op-based CRDTs, that can only send operations to other replicas, drawing a clear distinction from state-based ones. Datatypes with commutative operations can be trivially implemented as pure op-based CRDTs using standard reliable causal delivery. We propose an extended API – tagged reliable causal broadcast – that provides causality information upon delivery, and show how it can be used to also implement other datatypes having non-commutative operations, through the use of a PO-Log – a partially ordered log of operations – inside the datatype. A semantically-based PO-Log compaction framework, using both causality and what we denote by causal stability, allows obtaining very compact replica state for pure op-based CRDTs, while also benefiting from small message sizes.},
